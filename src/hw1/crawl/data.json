        "title": "Amazon's Streaming Video Library Now a Little Easier to Navigate",
        "content": "Having trouble finding something to watch on Amazon Instant Video? The retailer launched Monday an experimental browsing tool that lets users discover movies and TV shows based on their genre preferences or simply the mood they're in. Movies and shows are divided up into categories, some of which bear the names of genres (i.e., \"Comedy\" and \"Mystery/Thriller\"), and others which are labeled by mood, such as \"Feel-Good\" and \"Exciting.\" Users can toggle between TV shows and movies, and apply filters to show only videos that are available for free viewing to Prime subscribers, or ones that bear G or PG ratings. It's pretty basic, but it sure beats the haphazard organization of Amazon's current Instant Video page, which mixes rows of new releases with bestsellers and personal recommendations. The move is the latest in a series of investment's Amazon is making in its streaming video platform. Last week, the company inked a licensing agreement with A+E Networks to bring past seasons of shows from A&E, History, Lifetime and Bio to its streaming library -- shows, it should be noted, that Netflix subscribers lost access to in the fall. Amazon claims its streaming Prime catalog now numbers more than 33,000, double what it was a year ago. "

        "content": "The Associated Press is the latest news organization to experiment with trying to make money from Twitter by using its feed to advertise for other companies. The AP announced Monday that it will share sponsored tweets from Samsung throughout this week for the International CES taking place in Las Vegas. The news service will let Samsung post two tweets per day to the AP's Twitter account, which has more than 1.5 million users, and each of these tweets will be labeled \"SPONSORED TWEETS.\" This marks the first time that the AP has sold advertising on its Twitter feed, and the company says it spent months developing guidelines to pave the way for this and other new media business models. For this particular promotion, Samsung will provide the sponsored tweets and non-editorial staff at the AP will handle the publishing side. In this way, the company hopes to maintain a clear dividing line between its editorial and advertising operations on Twitter. \"We are thrilled to be taking this next step in social media,\" said Lou Ferrara, the AP managing editor overseeing its social media efforts, in a statement. \"As an industry, we must be looking for new ways to develop revenues while providing good experiences for advertisers and consumers. At the same time, advertisers and audiences expect AP to do that without compromising its core mission of breaking news.\" Other publishers have dabbled in Twitter ads, including The Atlantic, National Journal, The Times-Picayune and BreakingNews.com.

The company had a particularly strong holiday season, with 2 billion app downloads in December alone.

        "content": "When it comes to college football, NASA astronaut Kevin Ford is Irish through and through. Ford will be rooting for Notre Dame all the way from space during the BCS Championship game against Alabama tonight. Ford is currently living on the International Space Station, where he commands a six-man team, but tonight his heart will be with Notre Dame \u2014his alma mater \u2014when the team faces off with Alabama's Crimson Tide in Miami. \"The team's played great,\" Ford said in a recent interview with Notre Dame officials on NASA TV. \"Obviously the defense is very special, and the offense is just really clicking. I'm looking forward to a great game on the seventh of January.\" Ford has been living on the space station since October, when he blasted off aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket. He took charge of the space station's Expedition 34 crew a month later and will return to Earth in March. He is a native of Montpelier, Ind., and is a retired colonel in the U.S. Air Force. Ford said he tried to keep up with Notre Dame's games while on his current spaceflight, but he admitted the timing of the games is a challenge. The space station runs on Greenwich Mean Time, so many of the football games last well into the wee hours of the morning for Ford.  For tonight's championship game, though, Ford said he asked Mission Control for some post-game recovery time. That way, he can watch most of the game live during the overnight hours. Astronauts can watch live television via a satellite communications system, Ford said. \"It's normally used for science data, but on weekends, if it's free, they'll let us get a little bit of TV,\" Ford added. \"I've been able to follow the team and see a lot of the games.\" The astronaut even has his favorite Notre Dame garb on the space station to support the team. During his interview, he pulled off his Expedition 34 sweatshirt to reveal a \"Play Like a Champion Today\" t-shirt just for the team. He also has a sign that reads \"Explore Like a Champion Today\" mounted over one of the space station's hatches, much like the iconic sign Notre Dame players touch on the way to the field at their home stadium. But before Ford ever signed up for NASA's astronaut corps, he was a student at Notre Dame. He studied aerospace engineering and graduated with a bachelors of science degree in 1982. He even learned Russian along the way, something that happened to come in useful recently. \"I took a Russian class at Notre Dame,\" Ford said. \"Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would fly someday in a Russian spacecraft with two cosmonauts, speaking only Russian.\" "
